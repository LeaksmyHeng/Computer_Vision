Instructions for running your executables
     I use CMake to create an the executables. I passed in all the all arguments in the CMakeLists.txt as well with each of them commentted out; hence, you if you want to run any task, just go to the CMakeLists.txt, comment out the session in under "Passing the argument to run the ...." then run the program, the program will run fine after that.
     Example: To run task 1:
     comment out the line under "Passing the argument to run the first task"

Travel day: 0
Operation system: Window
IDE: Visual Studio Code
Instructions for running your executables:
    I use CMake to create an the executables. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can build the project by pressing Ctrl+c in CMakeLists.txt
    Then you can click run, the program should run fine.
    I split this project into 3 main file, main.cpp, camera_pos.cpp and harris_corner.cpp.
    main.cpp run task 1-3.
    camera_pos.cpp run task 4-6.
    harris_coner.cpp run task 7.
    In cmake file, I do have the comment on top of each add_execute to incidicate which line you should uncomment to run any of the task.
